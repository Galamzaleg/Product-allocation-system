**Product Allocation System: Goal and Macro Perspective
******
Goal

The primary goal of the Product Allocation System is to optimize the allocation of products (ASINs) to various Amazon seller accounts managed by the agency. The system ensures that the products are distributed efficiently, considering factors such as shipping costs, client balances, and ungating statuses. It aims to streamline the process of preparing and shipping pallets to Amazon FBA warehouses, thereby maximizing profitability and operational efficiency.

What the System Will Help Achieve

	1.	Efficient Product Allocation:
	•	Automatically generate product allocation plans (carts) for clients based on their available balances and other criteria.
	•	Prioritize the allocation of products that have been in inventory the longest to free up warehouse space and expedite sales.
 
	2.	Cost Optimization:
	•	Calculate and optimize shipping costs for each ASIN within predefined minimum and maximum ranges.
	•	Ensure that pallets are filled to their maximum capacity (volume and weight) to minimize shipping costs per unit.

 3.	Real-Time Data Synchronization:
	•	Synchronize client balances and store details with the AutoFBA panel in real-time to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.
	•	Fetch ASIN data, including dimensions and weights, from the buying portal and update the system automatically.
	
 4.	Ungating Management:
	•	Track and update the ungating status of each ASIN for each store, ensuring that products are only allocated to stores that are authorized to sell them.
	•	Notify administrators of ASINs requiring manual action for ungating (e.g., submitting invoices).

 5.	Streamlined Pre-order Handling:
	•	Manage pre-orders, track their expected arrival dates, and allocate them to clients once they are ready.
	•	Handle situations where clients have insufficient balance for pre-orders by reallocating products to mutual stores or requesting additional funds from clients.

 6.	Comprehensive Reporting and Tracking:
	•	Provide detailed reports on product allocations, pallet generations, shipping costs, and client balances.
	•	Maintain logs of all allocation activities for auditing and tracking purposes.
	
 7.	Enhanced Warehouse Management:
	•	Assist warehouse staff in preparing and shipping pallets by providing clear and detailed instructions on which products to allocate to each pallet.
	•	Notify when a full truckload is ready to be shipped, ensuring timely and efficient dispatch.

 8.	Improved Client Satisfaction:
	•	Ensure clients’ balances are utilized efficiently, and they receive products in a timely manner.
	•	Provide clients with updates on their allocated products and shipping statuses, enhancing transparency and trust.

 9.	Scalability:
	•	The system is designed to handle a growing number of clients and stores, making it scalable as the business expands.
	•	Automated processes reduce the need for manual intervention, allowing the system to manage larger volumes of data and transactions seamlessly.

 10.	Flexibility and Manual Overrides:
	•	While the system is highly automated, it also allows for manual adjustments to account for exceptional situations.
	•	Administrators can manually edit allocations, adjust shipping costs, and manage ungating statuses when necessary.

Summary
By implementing this Product Allocation System, the agency will benefit from improved operational efficiency, reduced shipping costs, and enhanced client satisfaction. The system’s automation and optimization features will save time, minimize errors, and significantly boost the overall profitability of the business. This comprehensive approach will ensure that the agency can effectively manage its growing client base and continue to provide top-tier service.

Integration with External Systems

1. Buying Portal
	•	The buying portal is an external system that provides data about ASINs, including item weight, package dimensions, and other relevant details.
	•	This data will be fetched periodically via API requests and stored in the ASIN table in the database.
	•	The buying portal needs to include the following additional columns to provide complete data:
	•	Min Shipping Price
	•	Max Shipping Price
	•	Dimensions (in inches)

2. AutoFBA Panel
	•	The AutoFBA panel manages client balances, including deposits, shipping costs, and service fees.
	•	The system will fetch the latest balance information for each client via API requests and update the client balance in real-time.
	•	When products are allocated to a client, the balance will be deducted accordingly.
	•	The client and store data will also be fetched and synced with the system.

3. Ungating Software
	•	The ungating software provides the ungating status for each ASIN in each store.
	•	This status can be either “Yes,” “No,” or “No, Invoice Needed,” indicating whether the store can sell the ASIN.
	•	The system will periodically check the ungating status for new ASINs and update the status in the database.
	•	If an ASIN requires an invoice for ungating, the system will notify the admin to take manual action.

Deployment Instructions

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/product_allocation_system.git
cd product_allocation_system

	2.	Set Up Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`


	3.	Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

	4.	Run the Application
flask run

5.	Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the Product Allocation System.
Testing the System
	1.	ASINs: Add ASIN details in the ASIN management page.
	2.	Clients: Add and update client details in the client management page.
	3.	Stores: Add stores associated with clients and update their status.

Additional Considerations
	•	Data Validation: Ensure that all input fields have proper validation to prevent incorrect data entry.
	•	Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling in both the frontend and backend to gracefully handle any issues that arise.
	•	Security: Protect API endpoints with authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
